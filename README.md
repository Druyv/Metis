# Metis
Personal Innovation Project Nick Goris - HU Utrecht University of Applied Science

The Metis Project is, primarily, a framework/tool to automatically generate and commit feedback on submitted programming homework. The way the project is set up should allow an independance and agnosticity of the programming language and platform submitted to, but the base version will only support Python code submitted to Canvas.

This project was built to alleviate a few issues encountered at the HU Utrecht University of Applied Sciences during first year programming classes of the HBO-ICT major. Every year HBO-ICT attracts approximately 500 students who all take the same introductory programming classes - this volume is so large that the HU can't supply enough in-house lecturers, so external lecturers have to be hired. This has two main consequences: 1. Quality of feedback is inconsistent, and 2. Feedback cycle can be very long. This project aims to alleviate (and hopefully eliminate) these issues.

One important note is that this project was never meant and should never be used to replace in person/face to face feedback sessions. It generates basic feedback (whether solutions function correctly) and performs basic code quality checks. In depth feedback should theoretically be possible, but is not the goal.
